# Thread-Safe-Malloc
Used C and system calls to implement thread-safe malloc library based on best-fit and first-fit allocation policy.
Implemented free list to efficiently manage memory, handled race condition with lock-based synchronization.
Improved efficiency by merging adjacent memory and splitting large chunk of memory.
